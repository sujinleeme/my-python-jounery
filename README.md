## About
I have been self-taught pythonist who started with zero-based programming since one of the hottest days of summer, 2014. The reason why I started Programming was to make Music! I join a small Python study meetup every weekend and turned into django girls Seoul then communit After that. Now, I tell my self as python lover and Django Girls Seoul co-organizer. This is a python learning respository to keep my assignments and exercises as well as enhance programming knowledges and skills.
